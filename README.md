# Overview:  
## Concept:
Breathing only from your mouth in long-term will lead to health issues, includes: Malocclusion, Facial differences, Obstructive sleep apnea. The Mouth Breathing Helper will help users to develop the habit to breath through mouth instead of mouth.  

## Structure ideation:
ESP32 with a humidity and temperature sensor will determine wether the users are breathing through mouth and remind them to stop.
An remote terminal with a screen and  a counter will show more information of mouth breathing in one day.

# Highlights:
## Comfortability
The humidity and temperature sensor is light enough to be attched to the mask surface without being noticed. Besides, the snsors will be linked with ESP32 board through wire, so the controller can be fixed on the mask, the area next to the ears, through a clip. The user experience will be close to having a earpod and a mask.
## Remote display device
There will be a remote display device to calculate the data of oral breath times sent from ESP32 and show it through a mechanical counter. Besides, there will be a OLED display to show some suggections to users to improve their habbit and get used to the new way to breath.
