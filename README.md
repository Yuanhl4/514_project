Mouth Breathing Helper  

# Concept:   
Breathing only from your mouth in long-term will lead to health issues, includes: Malocclusion, Facial differences, Obstructive sleep apnea. The Mouth Breathing Helper will help users to develop the habit to breath through mouth instead of mouth.  

# System expection:  
ESP32 with a humidity and temperature sensor will determine wether the users are breathing through mouth and remind them to stop.
An remote terminal with a screen and  a counter will show more information of mouth breathing in one day.
